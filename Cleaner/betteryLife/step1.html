        <h4>Avoid Maximizing Your Charge Cycles.</h4>
        
        <p>As per information from <a href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/why-lithium-ion/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>, iPhones tend to retain only up to 80% of their original battery capacity after approximately 500 charge cycles. A charge cycle is completed when the entirety of the iPhone's battery is used up—for instance, using 50% yesterday and another 50% today.</p>
        
        <h5>How can count number of Battery Cycles:</h5>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Head over to Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements.</li>
            <li>Make sure Share iPhone & Watch Analytics is enabled.</li>
            <li>Tap on Analytics Data.</li>
            <li> Scroll down to log-aggregated-2023-01-16-xxxxxx.ips (notice the date in the file name along with the numbers, and pick the latest file from the list).</li>
            <li>Now comes the tedious part… you can either copy and paste this into the Notes app (scrolling to do the copy is a pain in the rear), or, what I do is I email it to myself and look at it on a laptop or desktop.</li>
            <li>In whatever app you've opened the file in, search for BatteryCycleCount, and that will give you your recharge cycles.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's essential to note that maintaining the device at a constant full charge or allowing it to completely drain can have adverse effects on the iPhone's battery health. Therefore, it's advisable to maintain your device's battery level between 40% and 80% whenever possible to preserve the longevity of your iPhone's battery.</p>
