        <h4>Adjust Auto-Lock and Turn Off Raise to Wake</h4>
        
        <p>Adjusting the Auto-Lock setting on your iPhone to the lowest duration you find acceptable is a wise practice. This configuration prompts the device's display to turn off quickly after a brief period of inactivity, effectively minimizing unnecessary power usage.</p>

        <p>You have the option to choose Auto-Lock durations ranging from 30 seconds to never, but opting for a shorter duration, especially towards the lower end of the spectrum, can significantly contribute to preserving battery life. This setting efficiently minimizes display usage during periods of inactivity, conserving energy when the screen is not needed.</p>

        <p>Certainly, disabling "Raise to Wake" can be a consideration for saving battery life on your iPhone. However, it's important to note that this feature, while potentially contributing to power consumption, enhances convenience by automatically waking up the device when it's lifted.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open the "Settings" app on your iPhone.</li>
            <li>Go to "Display & Brightness."</li>
            <li>Toggle off the switch next to "Raise to Wake."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Keep in mind that turning off "Raise to Wake" may make features like Face ID less seamless, as the device won't automatically activate when lifted. It's generally recommended to consider this option as a last resort if you're experiencing significant battery drain and other optimizations haven't yielded the desired results.</p>
