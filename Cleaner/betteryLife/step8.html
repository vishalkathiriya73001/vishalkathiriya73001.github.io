        <h4>Limit Notifications</h4>
        <p>Managing app notifications is a valuable approach to conserve battery life and enhance the overall user experience. Here's a succinct version of your information:</p>

        <h5>To enable Low Power Mode:</h5>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Open Settings.</li>
            <li>Scroll down and tap on "Notifications."</li>
            <li>Choose the app for which you want to adjust notification settings.</li>
            <li>Toggle off unnecessary notification types or adjust settings as needed.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>By minimizing the number of notifications and their frequency, you not only save battery life but also reduce potential distractions and improve the usability of your device.</p>

        <p>Apple also has this handy feature that lets you modify your notification settings right from the notification itself on the Lock screen. Just long press on a notification and then tap the three dots (...) to get to options that include Deliver Quietly or Turn Off.</p>
