        <h4>Disable Automatic Downloads and App Updates</h4>
        <p>If you frequently find yourself with a low battery, it's prudent to limit background activities that your iPhone initiates automatically. One such feature is Automatic Downloads, designed to sync apps across all your devices by downloading apps from one device to others. Here's a condensed version of your information:</p>
      
        <h5>To manage Automatic Downloads on iPhone:</h5>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Open Settings.</li>
            <li>Go to your Apple ID at the top of the Settings menu.</li>
            <li>Tap on "Media & Purchases."</li>
            <li>Under the "Automatic Downloads" section, toggle off the switches for "Apps," "Updates," and other items you want to control.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>By adjusting these settings, you can prevent automatic downloads, saving battery life and giving you more control over when updates and app installations occur.</p>
