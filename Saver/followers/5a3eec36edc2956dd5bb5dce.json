The largest of these appear larger, closer, brighter, and more fully resolved with 8-point diffraction spikes. The upper portion of the image is blueish, and has wispy translucent cloud-like streaks rising from the nebula below. The orangish cloudy formation in the bottom half varies in density and ranges from translucent to opaque. The stars vary in color, the majority of which, have a blue or orange hue.

In addition to the planet‚Äôs iconic Great Red Spot, two of its moons, rings, and even distant galaxies are visible.\n\nSince infrared light is invisible to humans, the light has been mapped onto the visible spectrum. Generally, the longest wavelengths appear redder and the shortest wavelengths are shown as more blue.\n\nCitizen scientist Judy Schmidt processed these images and turned the raw data collected from Webb's sensors into the visual you see here.\n\nImage Description 1: Jupiter dominates the black background of space. The image is a composite, and shows Jupiter in enhanced color. The planet‚Äôs Great Red Spot appears white here. The planet is striated with swirling horizontal stripes of neon turquoise, periwinkle, light pink, and cream. The stripes interact and mix at their edges like cream in coffee. Along both of the poles, the planet glows in turquoise. Bright orange auroras glow just above the planet‚Äôs surface at both poles.\n\nImage Description 2: A wide field view showcases Jupiter in the upper right quadrant. The planet‚Äôs swirling horizontal stripes are rendered in blues, browns, and cream. Electric blue auroras glow above Jupiter‚Äôs north and south poles. A white glow emanates out from the auroras. Along the planet‚Äôs equator, rings glow in a faint white. These rings are one million times fainter than the planet itself! At the far left edge of the rings, a moon appears as a tiny white dot. This moon is only about 12 miles (20 km) across. Slightly further to the left, another moon, about 100 miles (150 km) across, glows with tiny white diffraction spikes. The rest of the image is the blackness of space, with faintly glowing white galaxies in the distance.\n\nCredit 1: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.\n\nCredit 2: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Ricardo Hueso (UPV/EHU) and Judy Schmidt.\n\n#NASA #JWST #Webb #Astrophotography #Jupiter #Space #SolarSystem #CitizenScience #Planet","image_url":"https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/300581088_760411555069743_5358710348549453076_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=GmiKlBzaQVcAX9AIej3&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AfA_fsW1ampIfLegTs-mX5ufvjVcpeb23BVCjTIc5l8rWQ&oe=638FBA6B","avatar":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/29090066_159271188110124_1152068159029641216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=86c713&_nc_ohc=nOZm8o0oGicAX92n7Xb&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AfCJkUAlyKSU-e0ZBeOgY0MMeo3ijLDjLKQwDn1ylcpwYA&oe=638E52B8","content":null,"likes":3531448,"comments":8772,"is_business":true,"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2022-11-23T00:42:26.352550","followers":84972791,"max_price":1557276,"min_price":760037,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"is_video":false,"album":["https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/300581088_760411555069743_5358710348549453076_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=ffjo8AZ7Bh8AX--qt_r&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCOw7ndO30fhIZwymygU0Ha74dYVm3WcSzelzhWNsaQng&oe=6381E2AB&_nc_sid=83d603","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/300934783_844964323159334_8883684592798755238_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=pF6OsUucmTgAX_BBHUS&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCkcH0TK-yC0DRBSYwXiRs6CYaHBhGN_Zx-dJApSrj8-g&oe=63832A2A&_nc_sid=83d603"],"location_slug":"","location_id":"","last_comment_ref":"17940429416170548","id":null}},{"date":1661990400000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci_hwGVNHGG","post_user_id":"5a3eec36edc2956dd5bb5dce","channel":"instagram","author":"nasa","created_at":"2022-09-27T01:59:57+00:00","title":"At 7:14 p.m. EDT (23:14 UTC), our #DartMission successfully impacted its target, non-hazardous asteroid Dimorphos, in the world‚Äôs first planetary defense mission.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) aims to demonstrate that the path of an asteroid can be changed using a kinetic impactor.

X-rays seen by Chandra (blue and purple) come from superheated gas, exploded stars, and neutron stars and black holes pulling material from companion stars. Webb‚Äôs infrared view (red, orange, yellow, green, blue) shows the Cartwheel Galaxy plus 2 smaller companions (not part of the collision) against a backdrop of many more distant galaxies.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nStephan's Quintet: 4 galaxies in Stephan‚Äôs Quintet are undergoing an intricate gravitational dance.

This image also includes infrared data from Spitzer (red, green, blue), now retired.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nDeep Field: Webb shows how a galaxy cluster, located ~4.2 billion light-years away, contains hundreds of galaxies. Galaxy clusters are filled with vast reservoirs of superheated gas seen only in X-ray light. Chandra data (blue) reveals gas with temperatures of tens of millions of degrees, possessing a total mass about 100 trillion times that of the Sun. Invisible dark matter forms an even larger fraction of the cluster‚Äôs total mass.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nCarina Nebula: Chandra‚Äôs data (pink) reveals over a dozen X-ray sources. These are mostly 1-2 million year old stars (very young for stars!) located in the outer region of a star cluster in the Carina Nebula. Young stars are much brighter in X-rays than old stars.

For instance, when Saturn‚Äôs rings are viewed from their edge on, they seem to be small and thin. However, when the planet‚Äôs orbit has moved enough that they can be viewed from an angle, the full picturesque breadth of Saturn‚Äôs iconic rings can be seen. \n \nThe particles that make up Saturn‚Äôs rings mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house, with a few particles as large as mountains. Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by its powerful gravity. One of the most impressive sights in our solar system, Saturn continues to allure astronomers, with recent @NASAWebb observations targeting its largest moon Titan. Saturn has also been visited by four robotic missions‚Äîincluding our Cassini spacecraft, which dove into the planet's atmosphere in 2017.\n \nImage Description: Saturn and its rings. The warm brown-and-creme hues of Saturn‚Äôs cloudy atmosphere present a gradient of color against the dark blackness of space. At its south pole, the darkest shades of the ombr√© pattern create a circle of earthy brown. Circling Saturn, grey rings are intersected by the Cassini Division, a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers), which breaks up the otherwise halo-like rings. \n \nCredit: NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA); Acknowledgment: R.G.

Though it may look like rivers etch the surface of the small moon, the cracks covering the surface are believed to be from relatively warm sections in the crust, where ice water particles and gasses jet out continuously from the oceans below, contributing to Saturn's E ring. Some of these fissures may be hydrothermal vents that stretch down to its ocean.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nEnceladus is a small moon that orbits Saturn at a distance of 148,000 miles (238,000 km) in a tidally locked elliptical pattern ‚Äì the same side of Enceladus faces toward the planet, with an average temperature of -330 F¬∫ (-201 C¬∫).

This could be due to the impact of micrometeorites, solar wind particle bombardment, solar ultraviolet radiation, or electromagnetic forces picking up electrically charged dust.\n\nThere is no cause for alarm though‚Äîalthough Saturn‚Äôs iconic rings are slowly falling they‚Äôve got another 100 million years of life in them. Ultimately, this unexpected interaction between Saturn and its rings could provide scientists with a tool for predicting if planets around other stars have glorious Saturn-like ring systems, too.\n\nImage description: A image of Saturn as seen in near-ultraviolet by the Hubble Space Telescope. Saturn appears an ombre of blue and purple, its rings appearing much darker than the planet's body as they reflect much less ultraviolet sunlight. Above the rings and the dark equatorial region of Saturn, a bulge appears as an extended band of white that is 30 percent brighter than the surrounding light blue regions. It's believed that icy ring particles raining on the atmosphere cause atmospheric heating that makes the upper atmosphere reflect more ultraviolet sunlight in the bulge region. The poles of Saturn are bathed in white hues, caused by the thinner atmosphere in this region which also causes auroras. The background of this image is the blackness of space.\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, Lotfi Ben-Jaffel (IAP & LPL)\n\n#NASA #Space #Jupiter #Rings #SolarSystem #Galaxy #Planet #Hubble #Saturn","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crawler.img/642b4e6f1b258456caefeb84.jpg","avatar":"https://instagram.fcae1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/29090066_159271188110124_1152068159029641216_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fcae1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=xir7BT1CegMAX9wCnv5&edm=AKEQFekBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBScgbOVQB30OKBKkuT_oK9qvLUWjqvoiN7PaOPS7HCgQ&oe=6430AE69&_nc_sid=035b3a","content":null,"likes":2073617,"comments":4110,"is_business":true,"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2023-05-29T11:52:50.976399","followers":92680471,"max_price":429599,"min_price":424775,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"is_video":false,"album":[],"album_video":[],"location_slug":"","location_id":""}},{"date":1682899200000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CsmeeiipLPR","post_user_id":"5a3eec36edc2956dd5bb5dce","channel":"instagram","author":"nasa","created_at":"2023-05-23T21:44:16","title":"Wow, Uranus is showing off more these days.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nPeering beneath clouds of the ice giant ‚Äì Uranus ‚Äì scientists have seen strong evidence of a large polar cyclone at the planet‚Äôs north pole.

There is a slightly darker tint at the northern and southern poles of the planet. The rings surrounding Saturn are mostly broad, with a few singular narrow gaps between the broader rings. There is an innermost, thicker ring, and next to that is a brighter, wider ring. Traveling farther outward, there is a small dark gap before another thicker ring.

This mosaic of the Moon‚Äôs far side is comprised of 15,000 images taken by our Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter between November 2009 and February 2011.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nCredits: NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University‚Å£\n‚Å£\n#Moon #Luna #Mosaic #WishYouWereHere #NASA","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crawler.img/65c547e3b29645d9f4aa73ed.jpg","avatar":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/29090066_159271188110124_1152068159029641216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7d201b&_nc_ohc=a6ra_X4GIBEAX-hC4Gd&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AfC2IDmhSqfLuwcZAoW_972RKJNrvTu4FCUZe7heWl-5-w&oe=65E58478","content":null,"is_album":true,"likes":6822123,"comments":20408,"is_business":true,"album_video":["",""],"album":["https://instagram.ftrn5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/425171110_876044904521979_2766495964267522410_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftrn5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=ril20PittlYAX-sUyel&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCJE2MY-fOb2w-1LQegmpaClgGuzQfGoEMLFr9Ae9XK4g&oe=65FD9473&_nc_sid=4f4799","https://instagram.ftrn5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/425526886_406090778600996_1124410708431045986_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftrn5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=LEvfSuzjuXcAX8J6VJy&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBTvMzrhYiwgJC6IDt9-ogqwsWfasPkuFY5hB4dOscS2A&oe=65FF0E7D&_nc_sid=4f4799"],"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2024-03-19T13:23:27.768896","followers":97972798,"max_price":454265,"min_price":449516,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"is_video":false,"location_slug":"","location_id":""}},{"date":1709251200000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/C46NlWDppbm","post_user_id":"5a3eec36edc2956dd5bb5dce","channel":"instagram","author":"nasa","created_at":"2024-03-24T19:58:11+00:00","title":"Did the Moon make you do it? üåä ‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nWalking along a beach you may see seashells, driftwood and seaweed left by the retreating tides at your feet. Look up at the Moon, and you‚Äôre seeing the main cause of the surge and retreat of oceans from our shores. As distant as the Moon may seem, its gravitational pull on Earth plays a huge role in the formation of tides.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nAs the tide rolls in or out, what you‚Äôre really seeing is a cycle of small changes to the distribution of our planet‚Äôs oceans. As the Moon‚Äôs gravity tugs at Earth, it shifts Earth‚Äôs mass, distorting its shape ever so slightly into that of a football ‚Äï elongated at the equator and shortened at the poles. This effect on the solid Earth can be detected by scientific instruments, but we can watch the same changes to Earth‚Äôs oceans just by visiting the beach.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nImage description: The waning gibbous Moon is pictured from the International Space Station as it orbited 262 miles above the Swiss Alps. The Moon is surrounded by the blackness of space, as it floats above the blue glow of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.
