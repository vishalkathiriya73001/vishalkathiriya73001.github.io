Giant otters are, well, giant—reaching lengths of up to 6 feet and weighing up to 75 pounds. Giant otters are rare across much of South America as they require pretty niche habitat, but they thrive in Manú because of the number of fish-rich lakes. These otters are social and rarely seen alone. More often that not, they go around in family groups; I once counted 15 in one group. Being in a large family helps protect them against predators such as caimans and jaguars.","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crawler.img/624b6c5518cd506f263b6ec5.jpg","avatar":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/277603428_552076426529300_897951030206377110_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=86c713&_nc_ohc=7ftmRZ_FdlEAX9zEqGU&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AT_fTmtrpyPWux9X0u4VGV0XHZL_18FUSTNq1scc6YNFiA&oe=624F9DAF","content":null,"likes":853652,"comments":6224,"is_business":true,"is_new":false,"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2022-06-01T22:47:30.558390","followers":224201340,"max_price":56589,"min_price":1,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"is_video":false,"album":[],"location_slug":"","location_id":"","last_comment_ref":"18045395011325737"}},{"date":1651363200000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdg-sSxOOIj","post_user_id":"5a3f1007edc2956dd5bb61e4","channel":"instagram","author":"natgeo","created_at":"2022-05-13T22:39:24","title":"Photos by @timlaman | The Vogelkop superb bird of paradise has one of the bird world’s most striking displays: its fake blue eyespots and bright breast shield are set against a black cape.

These catastrophic deaths come after 18 months without rain, the result of three failed rainy seasons. The low rainfall isn’t new, but it is the first time such extreme losses have been recorded. Interacting factors, such as climate change and overstocking of livestock, have made the land far less productive and far more vulnerable to shocks like drought. Though there’s water to drink, there’s not a blade of grass. Rains in the past week have slightly improved conditions, but unless they persist the problem will continue to worsen.

After hatching, the young pups are cared for by marine biologists, affectionately called shark nannies. The pups live in special tanks and graduate to special sea pens where they learn to forage for their own prey. When they’re large enough to deter predators and pass a final health check, they’re released into patrolled marine protected areas where zebra sharks have vanished because of overfishing.

On the other side is the environmental impact of such mega constellations—and Starlink will not be the only one. Frequent rocket launches increase black carbon chemicals in the atmosphere, which could exacerbate climate change. Sunlight-reflecting satellites would impact astronomical research and the night sky experience. SpaceX has been in the process of adding shields and dark coating to satellites and changing their orientation to reduce visible reflection from the solar panels.\n\nAs they travel to their orbit, they’re visible for several weeks to the naked eye. Once in the final orbit, they’re usually too faint to see unaided. In telescope images, they can appear as bright streaks that ruin the result, though they can be removed through a time-consuming processing method.","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crawler.img/64cc4053b809d7ae74486ab5.jpg","avatar":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/279785786_129563936340251_3274963801959382830_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=86c713&_nc_eui2=AeFNigV3zEgvzsR2us8Aq8zhYBRvE5RH1TxgFG8TlEfVPCkMvb01a4KM9hGKhqPohfZwFixjS9SDyFLeNzs0daW1&_nc_ohc=uCpa2lFFbhIAX_mVwKq&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AfBDwxL1sSxe6kXy3eqrtegEZeaKA21MPuyKFjdmhnORQw&oe=64D05506","content":null,"likes":929409,"comments":7498,"is_video":true,"is_business":true,"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2023-09-29T18:05:44.595701","followers":283305705,"max_price":1283531,"min_price":1281285,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"video_url":"https://scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t66.30100-16/120638698_312148727879765_5057612902175922753_n.mp4?_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=NOrXGL4SNpkAX_V8OXb&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBEQKwTDsveE8rwo6u9DKMwnrGEbq3h1aOooKlclPOLQw&oe=65188685&_nc_sid=4f4799","album":[],"album_video":[],"location_slug":"","views":7058641,"location_id":""}},{"date":1693526400000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxLyoXDJIxL","post_user_id":"5a3f1007edc2956dd5bb61e4","channel":"instagram","author":"natgeo","created_at":"2023-09-14T19:44:12","title":"The last scientific record of a sperm whale birth was 1986, without audio or video.

This “illusion of plenty” has haunted other species in the past. The IUCN’s decision to downlist monarchs from “endangered” to “vulnerable” raises many questions. Most scientists agree that habitat loss is behind the long-term decline of these butterflies. Although the numbers have been relatively stable in the past decade, they’re fluctuating around a much lower average. The new IUCN assessment is based on data from this past decade, but that doesn’t mean the monarchs are safe. They remain vulnerable to threats that include extreme weather events caused by climate change. In the end, many of us agree that we should keep doing what we can to conserve this species.\n\nYou can read more about the downlisting at the link in bio.","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crawler.img/652dcd4d4252fce700de7378.jpg","avatar":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/279785786_129563936340251_3274963801959382830_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7d201b&_nc_ohc=jsAFg5teRF0AX8ZbFBf&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&edm=AL-3X8kEAAAA&oh=00_AfDPUQ1Wr37jp0SEDP6zS1J8C_hSnfXAJCqHozTTZbGlqg&oe=652F4106","content":null,"likes":787350,"comments":3305,"is_video":true,"clean":true,"last_update_time":"2023-12-11T05:08:01.361358","followers":283746640,"max_price":1285650,"min_price":1283410,"location_name":"","location_public":false,"video_url":"https://instagram.fmle1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t66.30100-16/10000000_6643912785695886_472772214960417707_n.mp4?_nc_ht=instagram.fmle1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=78QVrFpwtXMAX_r-R7P&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCn3Cv9RZiXs02LQw_z_f30xQomaczWhCI23lWJxWKnjA&oe=65782F6D&_nc_sid=4f4799","album":[],"album_video":[],"location_slug":"","views":2939688,"location_id":""}},{"date":1698796800000,"post":{"tiktok_post_id":null,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzMXMFftaeg","post_user_id":"5a3f1007edc2956dd5bb61e4","channel":"instagram","author":"natgeo","created_at":"2023-11-03T18:00:23","title":"Video by @bertiegregory | A pod of wave-washing killer whales, or orcas, hunt three crabeater seals at once.

Harp seals are born on sea ice typically in late February and nursed for 12 to 15 days before their mother leaves to mate and migrate north. Pups require weeks of stable ice to develop before they are mature enough to survive on their own. Rising air and sea temperatures in the past decade have resulted in unstable ice that collapses, causing catastrophic loss of pups. I began covering harp seals as a face of climate change in 2011, returning each year as conditions allowed. It is nearing pupping time.
