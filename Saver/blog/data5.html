                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have been introduced to some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best Indian food vloggers on YouTube</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Instagram, you might be wondering what the secret to their success is. The following section will tell you how the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food vlogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> niche works and why is there a demand for such influencers in the present marketing scenario.</span></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_does_it_work" ez-toc-data-id="#Why_does_it_work"></span><strong>Why does it work?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food brands leverage influencers for two reasons. Firstly, the authenticity conveyed by influencers to their audience completely takes out the salesy approach that lingers around a brand.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, influencers have a ready-made loyal audience who are most likely to convert. It also has a ripple effect when the said audience will be liking, share, and comment on the videos which leads to a tremendous improvement in the ROI.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research tells us that utilizing influencer marketing the food industry boosts the engagement rate and</span> <a href="https://union.co/articles/how-influencer-marketing-improves-campaign-performance-and-drives-food-beverage-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>i</b><b>nfluencers bring 5x better results than regular ads</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An advertising approach might not always work as it does not provoke the audience to inquire further about the content. But with an influencer, the audience tends to get curious and would want to have the same experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making this work also depends on the type of influencer a brand is collaborating with. For major food brands with consumers all over the world, macro-influencers like celebrities and food critics with a massive following would work. In this way, when a person couldn’t decide upon a brand from a pool of popular food brands, their influencer might help them with arriving at a quick decision.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With local food chains and food brands, </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/blog/importance-of-micro-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>micro-influencers make a great impact</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> although they have fewer viewers and followers. Most micro foodie influencers are either youngsters or mothers enthusiastic about local food brands, famous street food in India, or the recent trend of completing food challenges organized by not only street venders but also popular restaurants.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food brands are thriving on micro-influencers as they have an extremely niche target audience which is useful to attract the local crowd.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing in the food industry does not put itself in a box where a community with only food content is present. Brands also use miscellaneous micro-influencers with their primary content being travel, lifestyle, or humour.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, small business owners like Sunday Stir, Chocolate Dough and Butter, The Madras Kneads, etc have collaborated with </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thatmalluchick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@thatmalluchick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is a digital creator on Instagram and has more than 2 million followers. Another example would be Snickers collaborating with comic content creators such as </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/srimathi_chimu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@srimathi_chimu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/akhil.jackson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@akil.jackson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their new ad campaign on Instagram.</span></p>

                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in venturing into the field of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food vlogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here are some effective </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vlogging tips</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could be of help to you:</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Know your brand:</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to narrow down your interest initially. This allows your videos to stand out among the fierce competition. There’s always an audience who is going to relate to your brand, judging by the rise of ASMR videos. Make your brand unique and represent you.</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Sort out your equipment:</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the food needs to look good. But you don’t have to wait for the ideal camera equipment to start your vlogging journey. You can start with your smartphone camera if it has a good resolution. What is more important is using a tripod and a good light set-up. Get these three pieces of equipment in hand and you’re good to go.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Be Consistent:</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s advisable to upload content at regular intervals as it helps with building a base audience. Make a list of content whenever you think of one and maintain a schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not necessary that you stick to only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food vlogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> videos. If you fail to create a high quality video, you can always maintain your consistency with some zoomed in pictures of mouth-watering delicacies or add a few informative videos on the geography of food hotspots.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you do, ensure that you maintain quality, and engage with your audience in regular intervals.</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Collaborate with fellow Vloggers:</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food vlogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to be friends with your competition. Collaborating with your fellow vloggers helps your videos to reach new audiences and spikes your views.</span></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Getting Sponsors:</strong></p>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of approaching sponsors for ads and collabs, you can start by talking about your favourite brands and tagging them in your videos. Showing brands that you’re a fan of their work goes a long way before you directly approach them. If you’re lucky enough, they might be the ones to approach you.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food influencer marketing is growing rapidly judging by the numerous YouTube channels and Instagram pages dedicated towards food content. An ample number of food influencers have already established their names as macro-influencers and many are following the path of creating art and food.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many restaurants, fast food chains, and delivery services, collaborating with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food vlogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channels is a go-to </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/blog/your-guide-to-creating-an-influencer-marketing-strategy-that-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>digital marketing strategy</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they are always on the lookout for the ideal food influencer for their next big collab.</span></p>
