            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong> The number of hashtags and their positioning matters!</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to best practices for using hashtags, one can tap into the following:</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using 7-30 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">top trending hashtags </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can help garner higher engagement</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning your hashtags in a way that makes them visible only after clicking the “show more” section.&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Twitter, using the 2 most popular hashtags per tweet can be beneficial.&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often overlook hashtags can lead to a lower engagement.&nbsp;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><b> Stick to your niche</b></li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niche hashtags get a little more specific, showing where you fit in the context of your industry, like #fashionblogger, #musicartist, etc. So, if you are a </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/blog/top-social-media-influencers-in-india-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media influencer,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keep an eye on which hashtag is the most relevant to your niche.
