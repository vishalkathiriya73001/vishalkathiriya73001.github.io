            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the mistakes which brands commit while implementing </span>influencer marketing strategies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not working with </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/users/top-bloggers-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nano or Micro-Influencers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike mega influencers or celebrities, nano influencers and micro-influencers share a close bond with their followers. They interact with their audience almost regularly which makes their social media engagement rate high and works as a reliable </span>micro influencer marketing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy for brands to leverage. They tend to be more authentic in terms of their follower base, which makes the audience listen to them more. What makes them more relevant is that they always talk about a particular niche or stick to it. Brands that focus on a particular niche can target these influencers for the execution of their </span><a href="http://www.influencer.in/influencer/campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>influencer marketing campaign</b></a><b>.</b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <strong>Not having an Objective for your </strong></span><strong>Influencer Marketing Strategy&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a clear objective can bring your planned</span> influencer marketing strategy<span style="font-weight: 400;"> great success. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, the majority of brands forget this important step, which results in poor brand awareness, engagement rates, and low ROI. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before launching a campaign, a clear objective is a must.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to increase brand awareness or need more engagement?&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to generate more sales or increase your followers? Whatever your </span><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective for the strategy may be, have it properly defined and then only move forward with the execution of the strategy. An </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might make this step easier for you if you have certain questions.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.<strong> No Call-To-Action</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw right now how crucial it is to have a clear campaign objective. In the same way,&nbsp; a common mistake we end up making while working on</span> influencer advertising plans is that we do not include Call-To-Action in them. The Call-To-Action helps the target audience of a specific influencer advertising campaign to take the desired action like on which landing page they should go or where they should click. Examples include buying a product, subscribing to the channel or following the profile. Adding urgency along with CTA at the end of the caption or content helps the audience to take immediate action.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Not Analyzing the Influencer Marketing Campaign</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of any </span><a href="http://www.influencer.in/live-influencer-campaigns-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>influencer marketing campaign</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not only depends on defining the objective, selecting the influencers and going live with it, but it also depends on analyzing the results. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing your </span>social media influencer marketing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> efforts and campaign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results is very important if one wants to measure the effectiveness of the brand.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have clearly defined KPIs, you can compare them with the results of the campaign. You can use different </span>social media influencer marketing <span style="font-weight: 400;">tools to analyze data related to sessions, engagement rate and click-through-rate.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Selecting Influencers based on Followers and not on Engagement rate.</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of brands tend to select the influencers based on their followers when it comes to Influencer campaigns. This is a common mistake that you can easily avoid. The number of followers is not always important but the engagement rate is.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement rate is a metric used to assess the average number of interactions influencers receive per follower on their social media. Engagement rate is calculated as the total number of interactions the content received divided by the total number of followers, multiplied by 100%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides an honest assessment of the quality of content and also if the followers are interested in the </span><a href="https://www.influencer.in/showcase-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">influencers work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If an Influencer has big numbers of followers but has very low engagement, that means people are not able to resonate with the content or not interested in what the influencer communicates with them. A </span><a href="http://www.influencer.in/influencer/campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>micro influencers strategy</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may work well in this case as it strongly relies on engagement rate in order to scale.</span></p>
