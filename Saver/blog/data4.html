                <p>When it comes to Facebook posting, consistency is the key. If you want your viewer to remember your brand, you must post regularly. As per <a href="https://www.rismedia.com/2017/05/04/facebook-page-beat-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rismedia</a>, “The more engagement Facebook sees within your post, the higher-ranking Facebook’s algorithm gives it, resulting in a larger organic reach for that post.” However, creating a social media calendar and adhering to the timelines can be tough. This is where a Facebook Post scheduler comes in<br>
                handy.</p>
                <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Can_You_Schedule_Posts_on_Facebook" ez-toc-data-id="#Can_You_Schedule_Posts_on_Facebook"></span><strong>Can You Schedule Posts on Facebook?</strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
                <p>When you schedule posts on Facebook, managing your timelines becomes easy and your posts become consistent. This brings a significant improvement in visibility as well.</p>
                <p>Up till August 2018, Facebook allowed third-party tools to schedule posts on personal accounts. However, as Facebook changed its API, it removed the ability to schedule posts directly on the personal profile using the inbuilt facebook post scheduler<br>
                But as a brand, you don’t have to worry! Facebook offers two methods to time Facebook posts on business profiles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Native Scheduling:</strong> You can directly schedule your posts on Facebook through its in-built scheduler.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-party Scheduler Tools:</strong> Facebook allows you to schedule your posts using third-party tools like Hootsuite, Social Pilot, Later, Spendable, and more. These Facebook post scheduler tools also offer options like advanced and bulk scheduling.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>Before we jump into Facebook post scheduling, let us learn about some of the best practices and tips to scheduling a post that can help you maximize your reach.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More than scheduling, what matters most is that you create content and posts that offer value to your audience and speak about your brand.</li>
                        <li>The best time to post on Facebook in India does exist! This is especially true for new brands that wish to reach maximum engagement. According to Buffer Study, the best time to post on Facebook is between 1 pm to 3 pm during the week and Saturdays.</li>
                        <li>Always check your post on the day of the schedule. Especially when you schedule posts weeks ahead of time. This will help you maintain relevancy as something you may have scheduled for a few weeks later may not stay relevant or appropriate at the time of publishing.</li>
                        <li>You cannot directly schedule posts on Instagram and Facebook’s personal profiles using third-party tools. Then, how to schedule a post on Instagram and Facebook? They offer post creation and scheduling notifications that can help you create a posting schedule.</li>
